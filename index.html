        <h1>Tobacco Bootstrap</h1>

<p>HTML5 Java web app archetype with latest and gratest components.</p>

<p>I always thought Java can do no less than RoR or any other fancy whistle framework out there without any mimicking aka Roo. So I decided to create this client-centric archetype that is always packed with latest JS and Java libraries, uses all the latests best practices and called it Tobacco because it's addictive!</p>

<p>Tobacco's focus is on providing modern stuff inside and make it easy to start a project with best of breed HTML5 templates and JavaScript libs, so you don't spend hours settings up the project, downloading libraries and placing them in correct locations. With Tobacco you always get's this done for you. All you need is generate your project and start coding.</p>

<p>Tobacco shows how Java can do modern projects in 5 seconds in it's own style. It doesn't dictate you to three-tiers if you do something simple, nor does it tells you which persistence layer to use, instead it tries its best to save your time on starting and setting up new web project and not be in the way after that.</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>Real website is worth thousands of words, so I setup <a href="http://zion.noroutine.me:8080/tobacco-demo">Tobacco Demo</a> for you to check.</p>

<h2>How up to date Tobacco is?</h2>

<p>Tobacco tries it's best to always include the latest release versions of most popular client libraries.  </p>

<p>Latest Tobacco 1.0.1 charges you with Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.2 and HTML5 Boilerplate 4.0.2.</p>

<h2>How to get</h2>

<p>You don't need to download Tobacco or install it, Maven does the magic for you. Make sure you have the latest Maven installed, at least version 3.0.4 is required.</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>

<p>Anytime you are ready to rock the world with new project:</p>

<pre><code>mvn archetype:generate                                      \
      -DarchetypeGroupId=me.noroutine                       \
      -DarchetypeArtifactId=tobacco-bootstrap               \
      -DarchetypeVersion=1.0.1
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a two-module project, which you can open in your favorite IDE right away.</p>

<p>You can also run it from Terminal right away to see how it looks. Go to the web module and run it.</p>

<pre><code>cd &lt;app-name&gt;/&lt;app-name&gt;-webapp
mvn package t7:run
</code></pre>

<p>after few minutes of terrifying console output, you can hope to access your new app at http://localhost:8080/</p>

<p>Read through <a href="https://github.com/noroutine/tobacco-bootstrap/blob/master/README.md">README</a> to get an idea how to get most from Tobacco.</p>

</ul><p>There is some dozen of other smaller and less important stuff that you find adding to any new project all the time or just convenient.</p>

<h2>About JPA and database access</h2>

<p>I didn't bother to configure JPA or Spring Security to create another zillion-and-one archetype for 3-tier Spring web app. It's overkill and just narrow-minded to require database for any project. If you need it - you can still set it up though.</p>

<p>All needed stuff is still there for you to configure or remove at all if you don't need it - it's just commented out and not used from start. </p>

<p>Work of H5BP and TB was combined and Bootstrap is used by default, but you can still easily fallback and use plain H5BP if you don't intemd to use TB.
That means that all the stuff from H5BP is still provided for you to benefit from professional comments, I tried to be as consistent as possible with original works.</p>

<p>All scripts have their minified versions present. JS and CSS is automatically compressed and aggregated if you use production profile. </p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>Thanks to H5BP and TB guys. You're the best and I just love you!</p>

<p>Thanks to GitHub, your service is awesome.</p>

<p>Thanks to Maven guys, you simply rock, but please can you make mvn less verbose by default ;)</p>
