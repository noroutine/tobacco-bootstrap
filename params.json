{"body":"_NOTE: The initial public release will be available in Maven Central catalog on Mon 17, 2012. Until then, please [install manually using instructions from README](https://github.com/noroutine/tobacco-bootstrap/blob/master/README.md#how-to-use)_\r\n\r\nTobacco Bootstrap\r\n=================\r\nHTML5 Java web app archetype with latest and gratest components.\r\n\r\nI always thought Java can do no less than RoR or any other fancy whistle framework out there without any mimicking aka Roo. So I decided to create this client-centric archetype that is always packed with latest JS and Java libraries, uses all the latests best practices and called it Tobacco because it's addictive!\r\n\r\nTobacco's focus is on providing modern stuff inside and make it easy to start a project with best of breed HTML5 templates and JavaScript libs, so you don't spend hours settings up the project, downloading libraries and placing them in correct locations. With Tobacco you always get's this done for you. All you need is generate your project and start coding.\r\n\r\nTobacco shows how Java can do modern projects in 5 seconds in it's own style. It doesn't dictate you to three-tiers if you do something simple, nor does it tells you which persistence layer to use, instead it tries its best to save your time on starting and setting up new web project and not be in the way after that.\r\n\r\nDemo\r\n----\r\n\r\nReal website is worth thousands of words, so I setup [Tobacco Demo](http://zion.noroutine.me:8080/tobacco-demo) for you to check.\r\n\r\nHow up to date Tobacco is?\r\n--------------------------\r\nTobacco tries it's best to always include the latest release versions of most popular client libraries.  \r\n\r\nLatest Tobacco 1.0.2 charges you with Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.2 and HTML5 Boilerplate 4.0.2.\r\n\r\nHow to get\r\n----------\r\nYou don't need to download Tobacco or install it, Maven does the magic for you. Make sure you have the latest Maven installed, at least version 3.0.4 is required.\r\n\r\nHow to use\r\n----------\r\n\r\nAnytime you are ready to rock the world with new project:\r\n\r\n    mvn archetype:generate                                      \\\r\n          -DarchetypeGroupId=me.noroutine                       \\\r\n          -DarchetypeArtifactId=tobacco-bootstrap               \\\r\n          -DarchetypeVersion=1.0.2\r\n\r\nThis will create a two-module project, which you can open in your favorite IDE right away.\r\n\r\nYou can also run it from Terminal right away to see how it looks. Go to the web module and run it.\r\n\r\n    cd <app-name>/<app-name>-webapp\r\n    mvn package t7:run\r\n\r\nafter few minutes of terrifying console output, you can hope to access your new app at http://localhost:8080/<app-name>\r\n\r\nRead through [README](https://github.com/noroutine/tobacco-bootstrap/blob/master/README.md) to get an idea how to get most from Tobacco.\r\n\r\nWhat's inside\r\n------------\r\n\r\nAll components are of latest versions. I'll continue to update this archetype with latest versions.\r\n\r\nClient-side stuff \r\n* [Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.2](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for your UI to not suck\r\n* [HTML5 boilderplate 4.0.2](http://html5boilerplate.com/) for your result HTML to use best practices available\r\n* [modernizr.js 2.6.2](http://modernizr.com/) to make your app display good on anything\r\n* [normalize.css 1.0.2](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) for your app to look consistent\r\n* [jQuery 1.8.3](http://jquery.com/) for you to write less and do more\r\n* [Backbone.js 0.9.2](http://backbonejs.org/) to make your JS code to be organized more MVC-ish\r\n* [underscore.js 1.4.3](http://underscorejs.org/) to give you powerful common library\r\n* [dust.js 1.1.1](http://linkedin.github.com/dustjs/) for you to use the fastest client-side templating engine on the planet\r\n* [dust4j 0.1](http://dust4j.noroutine.me/) to let you write your templates in pure JSP and make them dynamic\r\n\r\nServer-side stuff\r\n* [Spring 3.1.3](http://www.springsource.org/) for wiring your components\r\n* [Tiles 2.2.2](http://tiles.apache.org/) to organize your views\r\n\r\nThere is some dozen of other smaller and less important stuff that you find adding to any new project all the time or just convenient.\r\n\r\nAbout JPA and database access\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nI didn't bother to configure JPA or Spring Security to create another zillion-and-one archetype for 3-tier Spring web app. It's overkill and just narrow-minded to require database for any project. If you need it - you can still set it up though.\r\n\r\nAll needed stuff is still there for you to configure or remove at all if you don't need it - it's just commented out and not used from start. \r\n\r\nWork of H5BP and TB was combined and Bootstrap is used by default, but you can still easily fallback and use plain H5BP if you don't intemd to use TB.\r\nThat means that all the stuff from H5BP is still provided for you to benefit from professional comments, I tried to be as consistent as possible with original works.\r\n\r\nAll scripts have their minified versions present. JS and CSS is automatically compressed and aggregated if you use production profile. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n------\r\n\r\nThanks to H5BP and TB guys. You're the best and I just love you!\r\n\r\nThanks to GitHub, your service is awesome.\r\n\r\nThanks to Maven guys, you simply rock, but please can you make mvn less verbose by default ;)\r\n\r\nYour own Noroutine\r\n--------\r\nHis name is Alex, his key fun and profit right now is Java and JavaScript and his way is doing that without much routine. If you're interested in having your own Alex on board don't hesitate to check [more of his projects](http://noroutine.me) or connect with [him on LinkedIn](http://lnkd.in/9S-8ms)","note":"Don't delete this file!
